a) Ppattern file contains a code that creates a pattern to solve for n numbers where each intger i in the range from 1 to n is an input and o is the output. The condition (equation being), o to the power of o to the power of o (i number of times) gives i. 
b) Arrangement of data is an R code to jumble and then arrange a dataset randomly. This algorithm could be used arrange values quicker.
