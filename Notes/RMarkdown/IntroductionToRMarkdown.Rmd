```{r setval , echo=TRUE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE)#This will set the global option of all the chunks.
```

```{r printing , echo=TRUE}
#We can overwrite global options like this for indivisual chunks.
print("Hello world")#If you are making a plot do not forget to use fig.height and fig.width to set the border size of the plot.  We can set the echo=FALSE id we dont want the code. We can set the results="hide" then we can use the variable `{varnames_}` in normal lines too. Rmd gets converted to md and then it gets converted in html for us to see. we can set the results='asis' to get the output as it is on the html page. For this we can use xtable which a handly function. If the code inside the chunk requires a lot of computational power then we cans et cache=TRUE but we can not set it globally, if the code changes the cache ie, th e output will update too hence we have to see that one code chunk is not dependant on another.
